# Notes from CS739

Notes from [Remzi's CS739 F18](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/739/Fall2018/) paper / class.



## Week3.2 (9/21,F) - Clock 

[Week3: Lamport 1978](paper-note/CS739-Week3-1-clock-Lamport.md): You can establish a total order by forcing each event to have a time on linear relation.

[Week3: Mattern 1988](paper-note/CS739-Week3-1-virtualTime-mattern.md): Linear relation is not enough. To preserve causality, why not use vectors to preserve the relation?
